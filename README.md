# Basic ToDo Application
My own rendition of popular ToDo Applications.

# Summary
[Live Render](https://brendonh18.github.io/ToDo-Application/)
The app will:
-  add tasks to a list using a form.
- complete tasks using buttons.
- uncomplete those tasks if need be.
- delete only completed tasks using a button.
- and, batch delete only completed tasks using a button. 

I really dug in and had a lot of fun with this one. It was challenging to interact with an HTML Table, but eventually I found my path. Very enjoyable!
